# Description

push_swap is project aiming to improve your rigor, logic, algorithm forming, and aim for efficency in coding. 

## Objective 

To sort integers in <ins>**stack a**</ins> in ascending order from top being the least and using operations available.

### Available Operations

- **sa (swap a):** Swap the first 2 elements at the top of stack a. Do nothing if there is only one element or none.
- **sb (swap b):** Swap the first 2 elements at the top of stack b. Do nothing if there is only one element or none.
- **ss :** sa and sb at the same time.
- **pa (push a):** Take the first element at the top of b and put it at the top of a. Do nothing if b is empty.
- **pb (push b):** Take the first element at the top of a and put it at the top of b. Do nothing if a is empty.
- **ra (rotate a):** Shift up all elements of stack a by 1. The first element becomes the last one.
- **rb (rotate b):** Shift up all elements of stack b by 1. The first element becomes the last one.
- **rr :** ra and rb at the same time.
- **rra (reverse rotate a):** Shift down all elements of stack a by 1. The last element becomes the first one.
- **rrb (reverse rotate b):** Shift down all elements of stack b by 1. The last element becomes the first one.
- **rrr :** rra and rrb at the same time.
